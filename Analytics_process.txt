Getting Started and Loading Data

A newly hired data analyst at a healthcare organization that collects and assesses various types of health system data.

The boss already provided various datasets and files that must be organized to prepare for eventual analysis.
One of the datasets, dailycensus_7665.xlsx, is an Excel file that lists daily activity volumes by hospital ID.

Our first task will be to load this file into Power Query and assess its contents.

Step 1: Open an Excel workbook and launch the Power Query editor.

Step 2: Load the dailycensus_7665.xlsx Excel file (sheet dailycensus) into Power Query.

Step 3: The column headers need to be corrected. Use the Remove Rows feature in the Home ribbon to remove the first row.

Step 4: Next, you need to make the column headers correctly display their name by selecting 'Use First Row as Headers' from the 'Transform section' of the "Home ribbon" tab.

Step 5: Now, update the effective_date field to type Date.

Note: If a "Change Column Type" pop-up appears, select "Replace Current".

Step 6: We can sort rows by clicking the arrow next to the column header. Sort effective_date in descending order.



Managing Columns

More data files are coming our way.
This time, we have been asked to load a file on drug administrations and set it up for a quick ad-hoc analysis of prescription dates by doctor.

The steps will fill us in with the details on which fields to keep and load into the workbook.

Note:
Suppose we are opening an existing workbook from a folder at any point during the course.
In that case, we must authenticate the external data source connection once the Power Query editor is opened.

With a data connection selected in the Queries panel, click on Edit Credentials in the yellow warning.
An Access Web content window will appear. Click Connect with the Anonymous option selected.
 
Note: If working on macOS, one might have to click on Close&Load and repeat the above steps to authenticate each data source connection.


Step 1: With Power Query editor opened, load the drug_administrations.txt file.

Step 2: Keep only columns prescription_date and prescribing_doctor_id.

Hint
- Select columns prescription_date and prescribing_doctor_id by holding down the SHIFT key and clicking both.
- With both columns selected, right-click either column header from the data preview pane and select Remove Other Columns from the list of drop-down options.

Note: there are alternative ways to keep only the selected columns

Step 3: Rename this new query: prescription_dates_by_doctor.


Extracting PDF Data

We have been sent another data file to be prepped. This PDF file is a list of 11 survey questions that are distributed to patients who had a recent hospital encounter.

Our task will be to load this content into Power Query.

Step 1: With the Power Query editor open, load the Patient Experience Survey Template PDF file.
In the "Navigator" pop-up window, assess the preview options and select the one that includes all 11 survey questions.

Step 2: There�s a lot of unnecessary content in here! Keep only the first and last columns.

Hint
You can keep only the first and last column by clicking on Choose Columns from the Home tab of the Power Query ribbon and checking off only "Column1" and "Column12".
Another method could be to SHIFT+click the header of "Column2" to "Column11" and type DELETE.


Handling errors

We need to analyze the Patient Satisfaction Results dataset for a specific range of birth dates.
However, it's mentioned that there appears to be an issue with the birth_date column.

In this phase, we will use built-in Power Query features to identify the error and correct it.

Step 1: 
- Open the Power Query editor.
- Load the dataset patient_satisfaction_results.csv.
- Ensure the 'Column distribution' and 'Column profile' features are enabled.

Step 2:
- Locate the birth_date column. Let's investigate why no Column distribution or Column profile information is rendered for this field.
- Select Keep Errors for this column to identify the value causing the error.

Step 3:
- Delete the "Kept Errors" query step to undo it.
- Replace Errors with the proper date format, "05/3/973".

Assessing column quality and missing data

Thee boss warned us that several fields from the patient satisfaction dataset have missing data. 
It will be up to us to use some of Power Query's features to identify the missing data and correct where possible.

Step 1:
- Enable the Column quality data preview feature and identify columns with Empty values.
- Undo the "Filtered Rows" applied step on birth_date.

Step 2: Replace empty values from the patient_gender column with "unspecified".

Step 3: The boss asked us to check over columns ranging from question_1 to question_10.
We have been instructed to replace any column with fewer than 3% empty cells with that column average based on their respective Column statistics.
Round the average value up to the nearest whole.

Hint
Ensure that the Column quality data preview from the View ribbon is selected as on.
Column question_5 has 2% empty cells, fewer than 5%.
For question_5, clicking on the column statistics shows the average is 5.52626, or 6.
Replace "null" with 6 for question_5.

Step 4: Lastly, we have been asked to check over once again columns ranging from question_1 to question_10.
For any remaining column with fewer than 5% empty cells, we have been instructed to remove those rows.

Hint
Ensure that the Column quality data preview from the View ribbon is selected as on.
Column question_6 has 4% empty cells, fewer than 5%.
Use the Remove Empty cells command for question_6 by clicking the little arrow (filter) button on the right of the column header in the Query preview.


Removing duplicate data

Dealing with duplicates is important to ensure the accuracy and quality of your data.
Removing duplicates ensures that the dataset is free from redundant information that could impact the integrity of your analysis.

Our boss warned of some duplicate data in this analysis due to how the survey results were compiled.
There should only be one survey per patient. In these steps, it will be up to us to assess for and remove any duplicate entries.

Step 1: 
- Clear the filter on patient_gender column if it is still filtered.
	Note - do not delete the applied step "Filtered Rows", as it combined other filter steps that we wish to keep.
- Select the patient_id column. What do you notice about the distinct and unique counts?

Step 2: Sort the dataset by 'patient_id' in ascending order and assess visually for duplicate values.

Step 3: Looks like we have a problem with duplicates! Select Keep duplicates to reveal any duplicated data present in the dataset.
By keeping the duplicates, these rows now represent all instances where identical entire rows exist more than once.
Note the distinct and unique counts for patient_id.

Step 4: Now that we have seen at the rows that are duplicated,
let's go back and clean up that redundant data by first undoing the "Kept Duplicates" step and then using the 'Remove Duplicates' function.


Outlier detection

It's come to our attention that some of the survey responses in question_1 to question_10 columns were entered incorrectly.
The survey question response options range from 1 to 10, so any value outside of that must be addressed before proceeding to the analysis.

In this level, it will be up to us to identify the data entry typos and true outliers (where survey respondents wrote their own value outside the expected range).
You will be given instructions on how to handle each.

Step 1: Review the column profile for question_1 to question_10 fields to identify any columns with values outside the accepted range of 1-10.

Step 2: The data entry team confirmed they found a typo in the score entry from one of the entries from question_1 to question_10, and they asked us to correct it.

- Any entered value greater than 10 with duplicated digits must be reduced to a single digit. (e.g., 66 should have been 6).

Step 3: Keep our teammates informed of the error correction step by renaming the applied step just generated to "Corrected entry typo".

Step 4: Some entries were out of range, but not due to typos. Unhappy patients sometimes put a negative value as their score. Talk about an outlier!

We've been instructed to replace these instances with a score of 1, the lowest value on the scale.

Step 5: Rename the last two applied steps to specify that they were outlier corrections


Text transformations

A request from the patient experience committee has come our way.
They are looking to derive some insights from the patient satisfaction survey results to support their improvement project.
Our task will be to conduct the appropriate text transformations in order to derive what they are looking for.

Step 1: The team first requested that you replace the existing 'patient_id' column values in the 'patient_satisfaction_results' query
to only show the last six characters.

Hint
With the patient_id column selected, use the Transform tab of the ribbon to select Extract within the Text Column options.
Select Last characters and enter 6 into the pop-up window.

Step 2: The team now seeks to create a breakdown of diagnosis code categories. The groupings are based on a prefix letter code.

Create a new column with just the first character of the diagnosis column, and name it "diagnosis_category".


Step 3: Close and load the query into your Excel Workbook and create a pivot table from the patient_satisfaction_results table.

Calculating age between two dates

It's come to our attention that there are some concerns with the age field in the patient experience survey results. 
Our boss asked you to investigate by performing your own age calculation and comparing it with what was entered.

Step 1: In the Power Query editor, transform and replace the survey_date column to date only rather than date/time.

Step 2: Add a new column using the 'Subtract Days' function to subtract birth_date from survey_date.
Hint
- Hold Control (or Command if using Mac OS) and first select survey_date column header and then birth_date column header to highlight both columns.
- Under the Add Column ribbon, select Date > Subtract Days.

Step 3: Now, you have computed the patient's age in days. Transform this column to years by dividing by 365.

Step 4: Use the number column rounding options to round the field to 0 decimal places.
Rename the column "age_calc".


Numeric transformations

We've been tasked with delving into the daily census dataset.
Specifically, the operations team is looking to identify trends in patient flow by the effective date.
In this phase, we'll need to compare the daily inflow (admissions) vs. outflow (discharges)

Step 1: Select the loaded dailycensus dataset.
Add a column that calculates discharges minus admissions. Rename the column "net_difference".

Step 2: From the newly created net_difference column, derive a new column to extract the sign of each value.
Hint
- With the net_difference column selected, use the Add Column tab to identify the From Number options.
- Select Information > Sign.

Step 3: The new Sign column will show �-1� for days of negative flow (more admissions than discharges), 
�1� for positive flow (more discharges than admissions)
�0� if admissions were equal to discharges.

Close and load this query to your Excel Workbook.


Multiple column transformations
The operations team is pleased with the insights we've given them so far!

Now, they want more information on average occupancy and how the values trend over time.
This will help them understand which months of the year generate higher workload pressure.

In this exercise, we'll leverage our knowledge of numeric, text, and date/time transformations to get them the necessary insights.


Step 1: In the Power Query Editor, remove any filters to Sign if you made any filters from the previous exercise.
With the dailycensus query selected, add a new column that divides patient_days over budgeted_beds.

Step 2: Convert the newly derived column to percentage, and then rename it to "occupancy".

Step 3: The team wants to look at trends by year and month. Add two new columns derived from the effective_date field.

Create a new column to derive the Year from effective_date.
Create a new column to derive the Name of Month from effective_date

Step 4: Let's shorten the Month Name field by transforming it to display just the first three characters.

Step 5: Close and load the query into your Excel Workbook and insert a new Pivot Table from the dailycensus table.

Step 6: In your Pivot Table, display the average of occupancy with Month Name in the Rows and Year in _Columns.
